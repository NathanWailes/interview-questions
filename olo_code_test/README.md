Thank you for interest in Olo! Below is a code test we ask all of our candidates to take as part of their initial application.

One of our restaurant clients wants to know which pizza topping combinations are the most popular.

Take no more than 30 minutes to write a .NET console application that will download orders from http://files.olo.com/pizzas.json and output the top 20 most frequently ordered pizza topping combinations. List the toppings for each popular combination along with its rank and the number of times that combination has been ordered. For best results, focus on accuracy and brevity.

Submit your Program source file as a GitHub private gist - please reply to my email directly with the application console output.
