Given an arbitrary text document written in English, write a program that will generate a
concordance, i.e. an alphabetical list of all word occurrences, labeled with word frequencies.
Bonus: label each word with the sentence numbers in which each occurrence appeared.

| Word         	| {Count: Sentences} 	|
