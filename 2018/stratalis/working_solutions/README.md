I'm creating this solely for my own self-improvement.  These are not the answers I submitted, but rather answers I came
up with afterwards.  Obviously I'm doing this only for those questions that I did not solve correctly during the 
allotted time.

Note that I don't have access to the test cases, so I'm not 100% sure that these solutions would pass all of the test
cases.  I just know that these solutions appear to solve whatever issue I had gotten stuck on while taking the test.
