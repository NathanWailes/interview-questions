# Zapier application

- Position: [Senior Backend Engineer (Python)](https://zapier.com/jobs/4243772002/senior-backend-engineer/)
- Note: I submitted the application on 2019.05.09.

#### Tell us about your qualifications for this role.

I have been using Python since 2012, I've been using Python professionally (as part of my job description) since 2014, and I have been working with Python web frameworks and JavaScript frameworks (Vue.js) since 2016.

I have a 100% Job Success Score on Upwork.com, where I only take Python assignments.

Mike Borozdin, a former Senior Director of Engineering at DocuSign, hired me on Upwork and left this as his review:
> "Really great developer. I think he is a gem for anyone looking for Django/Python work. He will soon have a long line of clients looking for repeat work."

#### Tell us about the most difficult API/library/software bug you've squashed (we love troubleshooting stories).

I'm not sure if this counts as a bug, but the most-annoying programming-related troubleshooting issue I can remember dealing with was one I encountered in 2014 while trying to build an executable for a Python project I had created so that I could sell it without worrying about people stealing it.  I had to try many different combinations of 1) Python program to build the executable, 2) Python version, and 3) Python modules' versions to finally arrive at a combination that would build without error.


#### Tell us about an engineering solution you've built that you're proud of and why.

I created https://www.rhymecraft.guru, which has a complicated Vue.js UI which users can use to quickly make lyrics videos.  They only need to provide a link to a song file, tap along to the lyrics, and press a button and the website will generate a lyrics video that shows each syllable highlighted for the duration it was performed.  See the home page for an example video.


#### Tell us about your favorite technology to work with and why.

Probably Python, but aside from that, probably PyCharm.  I programmed for years with just text editors, without an IDE that has all of the features PyCharm has, and so I have a special appreciation for how much easier it makes programming.


#### Tell us about an industry trend you're excited about and why.

1) The development of the super-brain that is the Internet, via sites that make it easy for many people to collaborate (GitHub, Twitter, Facebook, etc.).
2) Deep learning, because it seems like it's really going to have a huge amplification effect on the productivity of people.


#### Describe your experience in python 

I have been using Python since 2012, I've been using Python professionally (as part of my job description) since 2014, and I have been working with Python web frameworks since 2016.  Python is my favorite language and the one I've chosen to specialize in.


#### Share some code (preferably Python) that youâ€™ve written. You can include a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or other public code repository. Or provide us with a 500+ Line of Code (LOC) sample via Dropbox, gist, or other link to help us get a feeling for how you write code.

#### Zapier operates at scale and does some pretty interesting things, rank the following in order from what you'd do best, the first being the best. Disregard priority or importance considerations and focus on your skillset and excitement: 
- **a. build a distributed service that executes 30k untrusted node.js scripts every minute**
- **b. build a persisted cron-like tool to handle dispatching 100k jobs per minute**
- **c. create a real-time system to alert us of subtle or unexpected API misbehavior**
- **d. write a user facing tool that can categorize & diagnose common API issues across 500+ APIs**
- **e. implement a new feature that spans both frontend/backend code**
- **f. build a custom database to help aggregate and analyze hundreds of millions of events per day**

e, d, c, b, a, f
