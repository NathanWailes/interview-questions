##### Why do you want to join Intercom?  Why is this role the best next step for you right now?

I'm trying to find a Software Engineer or Project/Product Manager position, although I'm open to other
opportunities. I'm looking for a remote job because I'd like to live with someone who lives abroad and
my current company does not allow full-time remote work.

##### What would your last boss say are your greatest strength and greatest weakness?

Greatest strength: I’m willing to do things differently to get something done in a more efficient way.
Weakness: My willingness to do things differently can rub people the wrong way.

##### When faced with a question you don’t know the answer to how would you go about finding the answer?

It depends on the question, but: Googling, asking people I know, looking in books.

##### What software impresses you and why?

I’m honestly a big fan of the software of my current company (Infer); I have seen firsthand that it is
no easy feat to get machine learning working in the real world, and the software Infer has created does
an admirable job of dealing with all the messy complexity of real-world Salesforce data.

##### What software would you consider yourself a power user of? What makes you a power user of this software? What simple change would you make if you could?

Hmm…maybe Excel? I’ve gotten to the point where I program VBA macros to get work done more quickly, so
I think that may qualify me as a power user. As for what simple change I would make: I would make the
formula functions better – add new functions, make the functions look nicer when you’re typing them out
(not all on one line), have a case-sensitive VLOOKUP, etc. IIRC there’s a company that’s already working
on this: they’re making it so you can use Python to code in Excel.

##### What is the most interesting thing you’ve learned recently?

I’m reading “Changing How the World Does Business”, a book about FedEx, and I learned the story behind
their name…I also recently read the autobiography of Phil Knight, the founder of Nike, and I learned the
story behind the name “Nike”. I’m not telling…:P

##### The following are items on your todo list for today but you only have time to complete 3 of the 5 things, which 3 would you chose and in what order?
1. Answer 10 customers each paying between $0 and $100 per month.
2. Answer 1 customer paying $800 per month.
3. Respond to your manager's request for feedback on a teammate.
4. Attend the weekly company all-hands meeting.
5. Investigate and write up a bug report for the product team.

It would really depend on a gut feeling that I would develop through experience, but at the moment I’m
thinking I would do #2, then #1, then #5. Personally, I think all-hands meetings should be recorded and
shared on YouTube so that people can watch them later.

##### What’s the most memorable service interaction you’ve ever had with a company (local shop, restaurant, app, global mega-corporation, etc.)

This is a tough one. I was pretty impressed with Visa on a recent trip I took: I had gone abroad and didn’t
realize I needed to let my bank know, and so my bank card got seized at an ATM. I spent lots of time on the
phone with my bank, and they eventually referred me to Visa’s “Emergency Cash” division, which took all of
a few minutes to set me up with enough money to last me the rest of my trip. The speed with which they were
able to solve my problem impressed me.

##### Would you rather be achieving your own goals but your team is struggling to achieve its group goals OR struggling to achieve your own goals but your team is achieving its group goals?

It depends on the relative importance of the group goals and my individual goals; at my current company the
team I work on has had some small group goals that everyone knew were not that important, and so everyone
focused mainly on getting their primary jobs done.
