We review applications on a rolling basis. You should receive a confirmation
email immediately after you apply, and we will review your application within
three weeks.

In general, clear and concise answers are better than long ones. Most answers
have a 1500 character max length, but you don't need to write that much.

We strongly encourage you to read our about page, FAQ, and User's Manual before
applying.

If you're admitted but your preferred batch is full, you'll have the option to

#### Code CracklePop
Write a program that prints out the numbers 1 to 100 (inclusive). If the number
is divisible by 3, print Crackle instead of the number. If it's divisible by 5,
print Pop. If it's divisible by both 3 and 5, print CracklePop. You can use any
language.
```
def crackle_pop():
    for i in range(1,101):
        if i % 15 == 0:
            print("CracklePop")
        elif i % 5 == 0:
            print("Pop")
        elif i % 3 == 0:
            print("Crackle")
        else:
            print(i)

crackle_pop()
```

#### Please link to a program you've written from scratch.
_You can use something like GitHub's gist to host your code. It doesn't need to
be long, but it should be something you've written yourself, and not using a
framework (e.g., Rails). If you don't have anything to submit, code something
small, like a game of tic-tac-toe._

That is one file from a program I created for a recent collaborative project
with Martin Connor, who runs http://www.rapanalysis.com/. We had the idea that
 it would be cool to create something analogous to basketball's "Player
 Efficiency Rating" for rappers: a way of calculating how good a rapper is in
 some objective sense. We decided that in order to do this we should get data
 on the musical characteristics of as many rap songs as possible, and then come
 up with some formula by which these musical characteristics would indicate the
 quality of the rapper.

Martin gave me a file with a list of rappers and songs (that's the "songsdb"
file referred to in the code above) and I spent a weekend writing Python code
to query Echo Nest for each of those songs and save the retrieved data to a JSON file.


#### What is the most fascinating thing you've learned in the past month?
**This doesn't have to be about programming.**

I learned you can cook raw and frozen fish / eggs / meat in a microwave. Apparently
when microwaves first came out there were cookbooks that showed people how to cook
entire Thanksgiving dinners in a microwave, including the turkey. The reason you
don't hear microwave manufacturers or cooks talking about cooking raw meat in a
microwave nowadays is that the microwave can leave "cold spots" (uncooked areas)
in the food, and so you have to be more careful to look at all of the meat and
make sure it has all been cooked. So I wouldn't recommend a microwave for a fancy
dinner where the food needs to look nice, but it's wonderful when I'm at work and
want to have fresh-cooked salmon for lunch.


#### What do you want to be doing in two years?

I'm a bit flexible, but my main thought is to strive to both 1) be happy in the present, and 2) set myself up to be happy in the future. Some things I'd like to have open to me are:
1) working remotely for a company like Zapier or GitHub so that I can do some traveling,
2) working on-site for a company like Google or Two Sigma where I would be surrounded by very smart people,
3) starting my own company.


#### Why do you want to attend the Recurse Center?

I want to get very strong at the kinds of problems you see on USACO's training pages
and Project Euler. I've found it very difficult to study those kinds of problems on
 my own, as I'll often spend hours trying to figure out how to solve something, get
 burned out, and then go a few months without trying again.

I have several friends who are stronger programmers than I am (they're at Google /
Two Sigma) and they say that this is the best thing I could do to become a better
programmer.


#### What would you like to work on at the Recurse Center?
**E.g., things you want to learn or understand better, projects you want to build or
contribute to, etc.**

As I said above, I want to get very good at USACO / Project Euler questions.


## Background
**This information will not disqualify your application. We use it to better get to
know our applicants and where they currently are. If you're worried that you won't
fit into the Recurse Center, you can read about some of our alumni.**

#### Describe your programming background in a few sentences.

I first started messing around with programming when I was fourteen so that I could
customize a videogame I loved. I did that in my spare time all through high school
and then stopped programming entirely while in college, where I majored in
psychology and philosophy. After graduation I spent a year studying for the LSAT
and got a perfect score, but I wanted to spend a few years thinking over the
decision of what career to dedicate my life to, and during that thinking-period
I concluded that programming was a better profession to go into. Since then I've
been reading programming books and working on small projects, working on my resume
and just generally trying to wiggle my way into a programming job.

#### Have you worked professionally as a programmer?
**If so, please describe your experience.**

Sort of.  I've created programs / scripts / macros in Excel (VBA), AutoHotkey, and
Python to do my work more easily at various jobs I've held in the past. For my
current job as a Data Analyst I need to use Python to do various things, and I
pushed for the creation of and then committed 3000+ lines of code to a private
company repository for data analysts.

#### Do you have a Computer Science degree or are you seeking one?

I don't have a CS degree and I'm not seeking one at the moment.

#### How did you hear about RC?

I've known about RC for many years; I don't remember how I first heard about it,
it may have been through HackerNews or Googling or an article. I applied 3 years
ago but wasn't accepted because I was too much of a novice. I'm applying again at
the suggestion of Richard Rusczyk, who runs the math community "The Art of Problem
Solving".
