## Steps to take when adding a new interview

- When naming the company folder, use only lowercase.
  - Thought: Why? Because it's easier at the command line? Is that relevant here?
- Add the question / prompt.
  - If the prompt is in PDF form, convert it to Markdown.
    - Thought: is it really necessary to do that? I think the reason people
    say you shouldn't commit binary files is because *when you update
    them* they take up a lot of space. But if you know you'll never be
    updating them, it should be OK to commit them, right? Or would even
    just moving the file take up more space?
